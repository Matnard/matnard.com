        <p>
          I am a French-Caribbean Frontend Developer living permanently in
          Sydney Australia and{" "}

          React, Emotion and more recently serverless GatsbyJS websites
          extending WordPress v5 Gutenberg's blocks.</strike>*/}
          Here, with my React and PixiJs skills I'm helping planting trees and
          create awareness to get koalas better homes{" "}

          I've studied analogue and digital electronics and really enjoy the
          low-level of things. I've been coding since high school and
          professionally since 2010, after landing my first job in Toronto
          Canada as a Junior Flash Developer.

          Data to Pixels/Texels is the side I'm interested in, that's why I
          spend time studying graphics shader programming and design principles
          to eventually make stuff "look good" and "feel good"{" "}
