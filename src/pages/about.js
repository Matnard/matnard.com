			<p>Hello everyone. I am a French-Caribbean Frontend Developer living permanently in Sydney Australia and currently working at whiteGREY.
			Here I create and maintain JavaScript applications with React, Emotion and more recently serverless GatsbyJS websites extending WordPress v5 Gutenberg's blocks.
			I've studied analogue and digital electronics and really enjoy the low-level of things.

			Data to Pixels/Texels is the side I'm interested in, that's why I spend time studying graphics shader programming and design principles to eventually make stuff "look good" and "feel good" ðŸ˜….</p>
